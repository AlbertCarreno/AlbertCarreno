## Hi, I'm Albert Carreno! I am a recent UCLA Statistics and Data Science graduate.

I'm currently searching for professional experience and opportunities to apply my data science skills. I am very open to work in most industries. 

## Featured Projects

- [Predictive Model for Batted Ball Outcomes]
Features an ensemble majority vode model that blends neural networks, random forest, and gradient boosting to achieve 88.3% accuracy.

- [Pitch Type Model]
Uses gradient boosting to categorize pitch types based on a multitude of factors like spin axis and vertical break. Achieved 95.4% accuracy.

- [Advanced SQL Queries]
Implements higher level tools like subqueries, CTEs, anti-joins, and window functions to return the desired information from a database. Worth noting that this code was for a class final project and related to databases that don't actually exist.
